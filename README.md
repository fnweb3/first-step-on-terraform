# first-step-on-terraform

Creates a folder with the name of the project

Copies the terraform configuration files with the .tf

Changes the values of the terraform.tfvars file (with some code editor like visual studio code)

Starts terraform in the directory of that folder with the terraform init command

Continue with the terraform plan command

Check that everything is fine 

We continue with the terraform apply command

If we do not need the virtual machine anymore we give the command terraform destroy

We are already
